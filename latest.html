            <!--small description-->
            <p class='contentBodyText'>Creative Industry Response, or CIR for short, is a major project that was assigned by my college, I was given a client brief and expected to make something that fufills the requirements, the main requirement of the brief was that it had to relate to Nottingham. Below is a video of the final outcome as well as a link to the full production Log.</p>
            <p class='contentBodyText'>This project was done in a group of two, I focused on creating the 3D models and environment while my partner focused on the scripting.</p>

            <p class='contentBodyTitle'>How I got to the Final Outcome</p>
            <p class='contentBodyText'>The beginning of this project involved lots of planning and research, I started with some basic planning like breaking down the brief and researching the client so I could have a good grasp of what I should be doing. After this I had a look into what limitations there are on the project and how they could affect my work this includes things like time restraints and PEGI guidelines. Next, I looked at project and time management, including risk assessments and methodology decisions. It was at this point that I finally started actual research which included initial ideation of locations, themes and game ideas, I also took the time to do some market research and see which things are generally favoured by the target audience, research on art styles was also done here.</p>
            <p class='contentBodyText'>Next, I and my partner decided to come up with some initial game proposals and then gather feedback on them so we could decide on the game the audience preferred the most, during this time we were also creating some more mindmaps and mood boards to go along with these proposals. After we had come up with a final proposal I created a few floorplans and proceeded to gather feedback on them, at this point, I also looked into into a few technical considerations like software and file types. Afterwards, I made a couple of asset lists and began with prototyping.</p>
            <p class='contentBodyText'>After the prototypes were finished it was almost time for production, I just had to gather and create some references for the assets I would create, so after I did those I could move ahead with the creation of assets. During Production there were a few things that I did, firstly I created sprint sheets every two weeks to keep on top of my tasks, the other thing I did was spend some time away from production learning a new skill which would be invaluable during the rest of production. After Production was finished I reflected on a few problems that were present during production and I also spoke about how my contingency plan came in handy, I then talked about my file management throughout the project and made a video of the final outcome. Finally, I reflected on the project as a whole, what went well, what didn’t, how I could improve etc.</p>
